# presignedURL
This is a simple script to create a presigned URL for an s3 bucket object, to enable shareable expiring download link.

Not my own work.
This was gathered from the Boto3 docs here:  https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html

Please feel free to clone and use. 

# Update these parameters for your own bucket details:
### bucket_name
### object_name
